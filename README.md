# Capstone pyhton project
Description:
This project utilizes Python and pandas for advanced analysis of employee, project, and seniority datasets. By merging multiple dataframes, I created a comprehensive dataset for extracting key insights. The workflow includes calculating bonuses for employees who completed their projects, updating designation levels based on performance, and using age criteria for promotions. I also transformed columns (adding titles, dropping gender), aggregated total project costs by employee, and filtered employee details by city nameâ€”all through robust data manipulation tasks.

Skills:
Data cleaning, Data merging, Conditional logic, Feature engineering, Data transformation, Aggregation, Data querying, pandas operations

Technology:
Python, pandas, numpy, Jupyter Notebook

Methods:

Merging multiple dataframes

Applying conditional column updates

Performing aggregation and filtering

String manipulation and column transformations

Result:
The final analysis generated a unified view of employees and their project histories, reflecting updated designation levels, bonus allocations, and total project expenditures. By leveraging pandas, I delivered actionable insights for employee performance and cost management, while demonstrating expertise in end-to-end data analysis and real-world business logic.
